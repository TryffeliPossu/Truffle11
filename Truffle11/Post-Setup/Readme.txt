Additional Information  
Truffle11 has been carefully crafted to streamline and enhance the Windows experience. It focuses on adjusting Windows settings, removing unnecessary applications, and including tools to optimize usability and performance.  

To help personalize your system, BlankShortcut.ico is included in the Customization folder to remove the default arrow overlay from shortcut icons, providing a cleaner, more polished desktop look.  

For users seeking even more optimization, Truffle11 is compatible with other optimized builds like ReviOS. Installing ReviOS on top of Truffle11 can further enhance system security and performance, creating a faster and more secure environment without compatibility issues.
